# Using GeoRegions.jl to specify custom GeoRegions

Recall that there are three different types of `GeoRegion`s: (a) `RectRegion`s, (b) `TiltRegion`s and (c) `PolyRegion`s.

## Creating new GeoRegions

We use the functions `RectRegion()`, `TiltRegion()` and `PolyRegion` to create new `GeoRegion`s of their respective types. Regardless of `GeoRegion` type, the **first three inputs are always the same**, in respective order:
1. The ID (`ID`)
2. parent `GeoRegion` ID, (`pID`)
3. Name of the GeoRegion (`name`)

```julia
RectRegion(ID, pID, name, ...)
TiltRegion(ID, pID, name, ...)
PolyRegion(ID, pID, name, ...)
```

Please refer to the respective pages dedicated to each of the `GeoRegion` subtypes:
* [RectRegion](/custom/create/rectregion)
* [PolyRegion](/custom/create/polyregion)
* [TiltRegion](/custom/create/tiltregion)

!!! warning "Constraints on `ID` and `pID` when `save = true`"
    When `save = true`, the GeoRegion `pID` must already have been previously defined, and the region defined by the GeoRegion `ID` must be entirely within the region defined by the GeoRegion `pID`.

## Saving new GeoRegions

As of `â‰¥v7` and above, new GeoRegions are no longer automatically saved. If you wish to automatically save a new GeoRegions **as it is created**, specify the keyword argument `save = true`. To specify the directory to which the GeoRegion information is saved to, use the `path` keyword.

* `RectRegion(ID, pID, name, ..., save = true, path = ...)` writes to `$path/rectlist.txt`
* `TiltRegion(ID, pID, name, ..., save = true, path = ...)` writes to `$path/tiltlist.txt`
* `PolyRegion(ID, pID, name, ..., save = true, path = ...)` writes to `$path/polylist.txt`

!!! tip "Default `path` Directory"
    By default, `path = joinpath(DEPOT_PATH[1],"files","GeoRegions")`. If `path` is not specified, the information will be saved in the respective custom lists in this directory.

!!! warning "Modification of Custom Lists"
    While it is possible to do manually modify the lists, it is not recommended to do so, especially for `polylist.txt`, which is pretty complicated. Instead, you should let GeoRegions.jl do most of the heavy lifting.

You can also add a `GeoRegion` variable in the workspace that you have not yet saved into the custom lists

```julia
geo = PolyRegion(ID, pID, name, ...)
add(geo, path = ...)
```

```@docs
add
```

## Calling saved GeoRegions

If a GeoRegion has been saved to a `path`, it and its properties can be called using its `ID` using the function `GeoRegion()`. There is no need to specify the GeoRegion subtype, as `GeoRegion`s with the same `ID` **cannot** be saved to the same `path`, even if they are of different subtypes.

```julia
geo = GeoRegion(ID, path = "<directory>")
```

```@docs
GeoRegion(ID::AbstractString; path::AbstractString)
```

## Table of user-defined GeoRegions

You can create a table of all the `GeoRegion`s that have been saved to `path` using `tableGeoRegions()` as follows.

```julia
tableGeoRegions(;path = ...)
```

```@docs
tableGeoRegions(; path::AbstractString, predefined::Bool, custom::Bool)
```
